Keys Storage
Design and implement an application that will securely store secrets (cryptographic keys and passwords).The application will allow users to authenticate and securely add/generatekeys and passwords and keep them safe, revealing them only to their respective owners.
## The application will minimally consist of:
- A web or desktop-based interface in which the users will manage 
their private data.
- A database, which will store cryptographic keys and secrets.
- A server component.
Presenting the application:
- The code must be available on a public git repository (e.g., github).
- Each team must make:
- A max 5-minute presentation about design and implementation
of each given requirement.
- A max 5-minute demo (e.g., Adding 5 users, encrypt & decrypt 
a given password).
- A max 5-minute Q&A session will follow after each presentation.
Requirements:
- A user can create an account and log in.
- Users can add/delete their own cryptographic keys or passwords.
- The keys and passwords can only be viewed and managed by their 
respective owners (no other user, including the admin, can view the 
secrets).
- All data transfers must be done securely (between all application 
layers).
- Users can generate keys within the application and then store them if 
they want.
- Types of keys that must be generated and stored:
  * Symmetric Keys:
    + AES (128, 192 or 256 bits)
    + Triple DES
  * Asymmetric Keys:
    + RSA
    + ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Users can generate passwords for specific usernames within the 
application and store them.
- Password generation is based on some user-configurable 
parameters (e.g., length, password structure)
- The database must be separated from the backend (In a separate 
container/VM where exposed services should be limited)
- Clean and secure coding.
- Some questions to think about when designing the application:
  * How secure is account management?
  * How easily scalable is the application?
  * What if the database gets leaked?
## Notes:
* There are no restrictions regarding used technologies and 
programming languages. You are free to use what suits you best.
* You donâ€™t need to implement all functionalities. Each one will be 
individually graded
